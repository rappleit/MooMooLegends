Fed up with the **inconsistency**, **lack of accountability**, and **insufficient rewards** in conventional carbon footprint tracking apps?

Introducing **Moo Moo Legends**! It's a **competitive multiplayer game** that **seamlessly integrates the tracking of your meal's carbon footprint**! Aim to keep your weekly emissions below the threshold, solo or with friends, and **earn cow collectibles** to expand your virtual farm. **Analyse your meals** with a snap of your camera, **learn from weekly insights and tips**, and **explore nearby food recommendations** that help to keep your carbon footprint low.
